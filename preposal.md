# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I started with the idea of a magic eight ball but I think I can take it a step further and make a fortune teller. I would like to have the user input a question and then using key words from thier question give an oppropriate random output. If this is attanable I would like to also add zodiac signs to the mix and have the user enter thier birth data and a question to give a more specific output.


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

none

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Do you think this is attainable? Do you have any suggestions before I get started?
